<B><h2> Sliding Window ðŸªŸ</h2></B>

<p> 
The sliding window technique is a commonly used algorithmic approach that involves maintaining a "window" or a subarray of a given array while iterating over it. The window moves through the array, typically from left to right, and allows efficient processing of a subset of elements at each step. This technique is particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions or have optimal properties.

<B>1. Initialization:</B> Determine the initial size and position of the window based on the problem requirements. Typically, the window size is defined by the length or number of elements to be considered at each step.

<B>2. Process Initial Window:</B> Perform the required calculations, checks, or operations on the initial window to establish a baseline or initialize any necessary data structures.

<B>3. Slide the Window:</B> Move the window by incrementing or decrementing its boundaries to the next position. This step usually involves removing the leftmost element from the window and adding the rightmost element.

<B>4. Update State:</B> Update any relevant information, data structures, or counters after sliding the window. This step is important to reflect the changes resulting from moving the window.

<B>5. Check Conditions or Perform Calculations:</B> Examine the current window's contents and evaluate any conditions or perform calculations necessary to solve the problem. This could involve checking for a specific pattern, finding a maximum or minimum value, calculating a sum or average, or any other relevant computation.

<B>Repeat Steps 3 to 5:</B> Continue sliding the window and updating the state until the window reaches the end of the array or satisfies the desired termination condition.

<B><H3> Why Sliding Window is an efficient Algorithm? </H3><B>

<p>The sliding window technique is efficient because it eliminates redundant calculations by reusing the information from the previous window. By maintaining a fixed-size window, the algorithm achieves a linear time complexity or even sublinear complexity in some cases.<p>

1.Subarray/Substring Problems:

Maximum Sum Subarray
Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Longest Subarray with Sum Less than or Equal to a Given Value
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Smallest Substring Containing All Characters of a Pattern

2.Fixed-Length Subarray/Substring Problems:

Count Occurrences of Anagrams in a String
Count Subarrays with Sum Equal to K
Longest Subarray with Ones after Flipping a Number of Zeroes
Maximum Average Subarray of Fixed Length
Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum

3.Multiple Data Structures:

Longest Subarray with Equal 0s and 1s
Maximum Number of Fruits in Two Baskets
Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
Find All Anagrams in a String
Longest Repeating Character Replacement

4.Optimization Problems:

Maximum Sum of Subarray with Size at Most K
Maximum Points in a Sliding Window
Maximum Average Subarray of Any Length
Longest Continuous Increasing Subarray
Longest Continuous Subarray with Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit

These are just a few examples, and there are many more problem types and variations that can benefit from the sliding window technique. It is a powerful approach that allows efficient processing and optimization of subarrays or subsequences in a wide range of problem domains.
