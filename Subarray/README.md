<B><h2> Sliding Window ðŸªŸ</h2></B>

<p> 
The sliding window technique is a commonly used algorithmic approach that involves maintaining a "window" or a subarray of a given array while iterating over it. The window moves through the array, typically from left to right, and allows efficient processing of a subset of elements at each step. This technique is particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions or have optimal properties.

<B>1. Initialization:</B> Determine the initial size and position of the window based on the problem requirements. Typically, the window size is defined by the length or number of elements to be considered at each step.

<B>2. Process Initial Window:</B> Perform the required calculations, checks, or operations on the initial window to establish a baseline or initialize any necessary data structures.

<B>3. Slide the Window:</B> Move the window by incrementing or decrementing its boundaries to the next position. This step usually involves removing the leftmost element from the window and adding the rightmost element.

<B>4. Update State:</B> Update any relevant information, data structures, or counters after sliding the window. This step is important to reflect the changes resulting from moving the window.

<B>5. Check Conditions or Perform Calculations:</B> Examine the current window's contents and evaluate any conditions or perform calculations necessary to solve the problem. This could involve checking for a specific pattern, finding a maximum or minimum value, calculating a sum or average, or any other relevant computation.

<B>Repeat Steps 3 to 5:</B> Continue sliding the window and updating the state until the window reaches the end of the array or satisfies the desired termination condition.
