<H6> Sliding Window </H6>
<p color = "black"> 
The sliding window technique is a commonly used algorithmic approach that involves maintaining a "window" or a subarray of a given array while iterating over it. The window moves through the array, typically from left to right, and allows efficient processing of a subset of elements at each step. This technique is particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions or have optimal properties.
